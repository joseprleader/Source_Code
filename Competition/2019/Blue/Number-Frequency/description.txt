Number Frequency

In this problem you are given a list of positive integer values between 1 and 100 inclusive. 
Determine how many times each value is entered. 
Display each number entered and how many times it was entered. 
Read each number from the console. Display the output on the monitor. 
Run your application once for each set of test data. 

Input

Prompt the user as shown in the sample input below. 
Then enter some number of positive integers between 1 and 100. 
Any number of values can be entered. Each will be separated by a space. 
At least one non-zero number will be entered. 
The last integer in the list will be a zero indicating the end of the data. 
The zero is NOT part of the list. Read each number from the console.

Output
