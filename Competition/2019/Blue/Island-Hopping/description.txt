Island Hopping

A list of integers is used to represent the “jumping distance” between islands. 
Use these numbers to determine if you can “jump” from one island to the next and land exactly on the last island. 
For example, given the list:

3 1 0 1 3

The first entry always represents the starting point. 
From the starting point you can jump 3 islands. 
This will take you to the island represented by the number 1. 
From that island you can jump 1 position to the last island. 
This represents success.

Now consider a list like:

4 3 2 1 0 2 3

Again, you would start on the first island (4) and could jump 4 islands to the island represented by 0.
From this island you can’t jump any further so the last island cannot be reached. 
This represents failure. 
It is also a failure if your “jump” would take you past the last island.

Input

The first integer (N) is the number of integers to follow. 
The first integer is NOT part of the “jumping” data. 
After the first integer, N number of integers will follow.
Each integer will be greater than or equal to zero.
Read all the data from the console. 

Output

“Success” if the last “island” can be reached without going past the end of the list. 
“Failure” if the last island cannot be reached. Display the output on the monitor.
