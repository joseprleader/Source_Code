In this problem you are given a list of characters followed by a sentence. 
You must determine if the sentence can be formed using only the letters from the first list. 
Each letter in the first list can only be used once. There will be no punctuation in either list. 
For example, given the list “friend icing on the sung” can the sentence “coding is fun” be formed? The answer is yes. 
However, given the list “please bake umpteen cookies” you can’t form the sentence “bugs are problems”. 

Input 

Two strings with each string having at least one character. 
The second string may be longer, shorter, or the same length as the first string. 
All letters input will be lowercase. Read all the data from the console. 
Output

Display the word “possible” if the second string can be created using the letters contained in the first string. 
Display the word “not possible” if the second string can’t be created using the letters contained in the first string. 
Display the output on the monitor.
