In this problem youâ€™ll be given the length of two sides of a right triangle and need to calculate the name and length of the third side. 
The two given sides can change. 
In other words, the same two sides are not always provided. 
Review the right triangle below.

The right triangle has sides AB, BC, and AC.
 Side AC is always the hypotenuse. 
 Assume you are given the following input: AB is 3, BC is 4. 
 Your application must identify the missing side as AC and the length as 5.
