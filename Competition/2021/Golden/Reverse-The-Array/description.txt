In this problem you will build a new array using the numbers from an existing array. 
Add each number, one at a time, to the end of the new array. 
Then reverse the order of the numbers in the new array. 
Repeat this for each number added. 
For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
Add the first element [1] to the end of a new array and reverse it.
Then add the second element [2] to the end of the new array and reverse the array. 
Repeat this process n times where n is the size of the array. 
The result is the array [4, 2, 1, 3]. 
Below are the detailed steps for the array [1, 2, 3, 4].

Sample Data:

INPUT:                                                  OUTPUT:
Enter count, integers separated by a space:
6 4 8 6 1 7 9                                           9 1 8 4 6 7

Enter count, integers separated by a space:
4 1 2 3 4                                               4 2 1 3

Enter count, integers separated by a space:
7 33 18 97 108 13 11 9                                  9 13 97 33 18 108 11
