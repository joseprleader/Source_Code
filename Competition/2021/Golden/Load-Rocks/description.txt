The Rockland Quarry stores rocks in bags. 
The first bag on the shelf has 1 pound of rocks, the next bag has 2 pounds of rocks, the next has 3 pounds of rocks and so on. 
The quarry has an unlimited number of bags of rocks. 
In other words, the heaviest bag stored weighs as much as the largest integer value. 
A customer specifies a weight when ordering rocks. 
Rocky, the forklift operator, always takes bags from adjacent locations to meet the required weight. 
He also always takes a minimum of two bags. 
You must write an application to help Rocky find all the possible combinations of rock bags with consecutive weights that will total the weight the customer ordered. 
For example, Bobby Stone has ordered 15 pounds of rock. 
There are 3 combinations of consecutive weights that will add to 15. 
These are:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
    4 + 5 + 6 = 15
    7 + 8 = 15

For some large orders the number of combinations could be quite high and result in a large amount of output. 
To reduce the amount of output and still prove the application works the owner, Mr. Slate, has agreed to accept two pieces of data instead. 
The first is the number of combinations that meet the criteria. 
The second is the sum of the first number in each combination. 
For an order of 15 pounds the output would be 3 and 12. The 12 was calculated as 1 + 4 + 7.
